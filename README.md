# Local Tic-Tac-Toe

*- This is a small minigame that anyone can play it with a friend locally.*

## Technology Used

This Project was written with `NodeJs`. I used the following libraries:

* `express`, `socketIO`

## How to play

After downloading all the necessary packages and you are all set up, run nodemon:
```bash 
npx nodemon app.js
```
*- You need to be inside the src folder. -*

After starting the server you just need to find your local-IP and connect to the `localhost:3000`. 

Afterwards your friend needs to connect to your local-IP `xxx.xxx.xxx:3000`.

*- Good Luck as the Game just began -*

## Final Thoughts

This Game was made as fast as possible so clearly you will find a ton of `Bugs`. *Hope you have fun!*
